              Downs Memorial was first established as Golden Gate Methodist Episcopal in 1890 and was located at 57th and Gaskill Streets in Oakland.  In 1916 the church moved to San Pablo and 56th Streets.  The present site was purchased in 1924 and the church was completed in 1925; Fuller Hall was added in 1940.  Golden Gate Methodist Episcopal closed in 1946, but reopened in 1948 to accommodate the large numbers of African-American men and women who returned to the East Bay after WWII.

              In 1948 the church was renamed Downs Memorial Methodist Church in honor of Reverend Karl Downs, president of Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas., and renamed again as Downs Memorial United Methodist Church in 1968.  Our church has ministered to the African-American community of the San Francisco Bay Area for more than 126 years and continues to provide a spiritual home for many
